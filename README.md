The following is an exercise in learning to use a code repository.
In the timecard file you will be entering your name on the line that corresponds with the date that you have submitted your timecard.

# Instructions
<ul>
	<li>Start by opening the timecardreport file and inputting your name on the correct line.
	<li>At the bottom of the page choose "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" and add a description to your commit
	<ul>
		<li>This will not yet edit the original document but create a ‘branch’ for you to edit further then merge back with the master file when ready. 
 		<li>This allows for many people to be working on the same code at once.
	</ul>
	<li>On the next screen choose create pull request
	<li>Verify that there is no conflict (It should be green) 
	<li>Merge this branch with the master document
	<li>Delete your branch now that it has been merged.
</ul>
