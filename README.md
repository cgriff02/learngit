# learngit

The following is an exercise in learning to use a code repository.
In the timecard file you will be entering your name on the line that corresponds with the date that you have submitted your timecard.

# Instructions
Start by opening the timecardreport file and inputting your name on the correct line.
At the bottom of the page choose "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" and add a description to your commit
	This will not yet edit the original document but create a ‘branch’ for you to edit further then merge back with the master file when ready. 
  This allows for many people to be working on the same code at once.
On the next screen choose create pull request
Verify that there is no conflict (It should be green) 
Merge this branch with the master document
Delete your branch now that it has been merged.
